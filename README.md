# Self Organizing Maps (SOMap)

A self-organizing map [(SOM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map)
is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional
(typically two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data set while
preserving the topological structure of the data.

(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
